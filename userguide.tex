% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The GridPP Collaboration is a community of particle physicists and computer
scientists based in the United Kingdom and at CERN.
This document is an offline version of the GridPP UserGuide,
written as part of GridPP's New User Engagement Programme,
that aims to help new users make use of GridPP resources
through the DIRAC, Ganga and CernVM suite of technologies.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The author would like to thank GridPP Collaboration members Steve Jones
(Liverpool) and Steve Lloyd (QMUL), as well as the students from the
\href{http://researchinschools.org}{Institute for Research in Schools},
for providing invaluable feedback on the initial drafts of the
\emph{GridPP UserGuide}.
Andrew McNab (Uni. Manchester) has provided invaluable technical support
for the operation and maintenance of the
\href{http://www.gridpp.ac.uk}{GridPP website} on which the online
version of this guide is hosted\footnote{%
See \href{http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/userguide}{http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/userguide}}.
%
Much inspiration for the structure and
philosophy of the \emph{GridPP UserGuide} has been drawn from Michael
Hartl's \emph{\href{https://ww.railstutorial.org}{Ruby on Rails
Tutorial}} - an excellent read (even if you're not particularly fussed
about Ruby on Rails). We are also grateful to
\href{http://github.com}{GitHub} for our
\href{http://github.com/gridpp}{Organizational Repository} -- thanks!

This work was supported by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council
(STFC) via the GridPP Collaboration~\cite{gridpp2006,gridpp2009}
and grant ST/N00101X/1 as part of work with the CERN@school research
programme.
