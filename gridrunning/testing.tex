\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sourcing the DIRAC environment}: You can test the DIRAC
  environment variables have been set using the \texttt{echo} command.
  For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$ }\KeywordTok{echo} \OtherTok{$DIRAC}
\KeywordTok{/cvmfs/ganga.cern.ch/dirac_ui/}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  If the DIRAC home directory on CVMFS is not listed, the environment
  variables have not been set correctly.
\item
  \textbf{Generating a DIRAC proxy}: You can test if your proxy
  generation has been successful by using the \texttt{dirac-proxy-info}
  command.
\item
  \textbf{Successful running of the CERN@school example job}: As with
  the locally-run example, once you have run and retrieved the images
  from the example job the first frame image should look something like
  that seen in Figure~\ref{fig:localrunningframe}.
\end{itemize}
