\begin{itemize}

\item
  I have installed some virtualisation software on my local machine that
  is compatible with the CernVM images listed at:

  \url{http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/downloads}.
\item
  I have downloaded the corresponding CernVM image to my local machine
  from the CernVM image download page;
\item
  I have created a new guest VM on my local machine using the CernVM
  image;
\item
  I have registered with the CernVM service
  (or I am a CERN computing account holder);
\item
  I have generated a six-digit PIN to pair my CernVM with the GridPP
  context via the CernVM Marketplace;
\item
  I have entered the six-digit PIN (preceeded by the hash symbol) into
  the login prompt of my newly-booted CernVM;
\item
  I have logged in to my new GridPP CernVM using the \texttt{gridpp}
  user account;
\item
  I have accessed folders from my local machine's hard disk from my
  GridPP CernVM.
\end{itemize}
