\section{Getting on the Grid}
\label{sec:onthegrid}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We have run local jobs so far. Now it's time to get on the grid - after
which, we will be able to configure Ganga to submit our jobs to the
GridPP DIRAC system and so access all of the computing and data
resources GridPP has to offer. The following sections will cover:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Getting a grid certificate (Section~\ref{sec:gridcert});
\item
  Joining a Virtual Organisation (Section~\ref{sec:joinvo});
\item
  Logging on to GridPP DIRAC.
\end{itemize}

We'll find out more about what each of these steps mean and entail as we
go.

\begin{warningbox}{Thinking ahead}
\emph{Some of these steps require interaction with a human being. For example,
to get a grid certificate you have to visit your local Registration
Authority in person with photographic ID. Please bear this in mind
before you begin - it is not an automated process and may take a little
time. It will be worth it though!}
\end{warningbox}

Let's start by getting you a Grid certificate, shall we?
